### Random notes

Possible heroes archetypes:
- Sword (long and pointy)
  - Mouse holds the hilt, rotates around egg
  - Moves fast radially, but slow inward/outward
- Shield (wide and flattish/roundish)
  - Mouse holds the handle, rotates around egg
  - Moves slow radially, but fast inward/outward
- Mace (ball + chain + stick)
  - Mouse holds the stick, swings ball around

Each hero could have 2 sides, red and blue:
- Hit red enemies with red (baddies)
- Hit blue enemies with blue (food? powerups?)

Iterate!

Various shapes, various movement/rotation

- Line/Block : Always static rot
- Cup : Rotates around egg
- Any : Follows mouse rot, Moves to mouse when mousedown relative (or up?)
  - May want to lock mouse (html5 api)

There should be some dissencentive for moving mouse/shield over egg
- slows down shield?
- damages egg?

any way to move physics / game logic into GPU?

Everytime you destroy an enemy, your "egg meter" increases
When it's full, you can lay an egg in your nest
Slightly increases size of nest, but increases final score
