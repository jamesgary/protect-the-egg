# Safety Game

Protect egg!

First steps...
- [x] Draw egg (just a cirlce)
- [x] Draw hero (another cirlce)
- [x] Hero follows mouse
- [x] Draw/move enemies
- [ ] Collide with hero
- [ ] Collide with egg
- [ ] Make hero semi-circle and rotate around egg

Iterate!

Various shapes, various movement/rotation

- Line/Block : Always static rot
- Cup : Rotates around egg
- Any : Follows mouse rot, Moves to mouse when mousedown relative (or up?)
  - May want to lock mouse (html5 api)

There should be some dissencentive for moving mouse/shield over egg
- slows down shield?
- damages egg?

any way to move physics / game logic into GPU?
